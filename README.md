Extending GC Statepoints for Stackless Runtime Models
=====================================================

Introduction
------------

LLVM's Garbage Collection (GC) [Statepoints](http://llvm.org/docs/Statepoints.html) provide support for language runtime systems that use precise GC.
The primary goal of the Statepoints system is to output information alongside the generated assembly that describes where the code generator has placed live pointers in each frame of the call stack.
This information [can be used](https://github.com/kavon/llvm-statepoint-utils) by the collector of the front-end language's runtime system to identify live pointers in each stack frame during a garbage collection cycle.

The Statepoints system can go further to support runtime systems that have a "stackless" mode, where the normal call stack is not in use. A second stack, represented as a pointer value in the IR, is explicity passed to the function as an argument to be used for further function calls and to return.

Stackless models are often used to implement lightweight [green threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads). For example, Cilk has used this type of green thread for their concurrent work-stealing runtime system [1,2].
The stackless model can also be used to efficiently implement other control-flow mechanisms derived from `call-with-current-continuation`, which is found in a number of languages like [Ruby](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Continuation.html) and is also [available in Boost](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/context/doc/html/context/cc.html) for [C++ proposal P0534R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0534r3.pdf).
Some compilers for functional languages such as [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Haskell_Compiler), [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML_of_New_Jersey), and Scheme also use this "stackless" approach.



Current Functionality
---------------------

The current [Statepoint call intrinsic](https://llvm.org/docs/Statepoints.html#llvm-experimental-gc-statepoint-intrinsic) is a wrapper for a call to a function during which a garbage-collection cycle may occur.
A Statepoint enables the construction of code with the property that a garbage-collected pointer's value may change during the call (to support moving GC). That is, after the call returns, you must use the new, relocated pointer returned by [`gc.relocate` intrinsics](https://llvm.org/docs/Statepoints.html#llvm-experimental-gc-relocate-intrinsic) in the IR, as the prior version is no longer valid.
All garbage-collected pointers that are live after the statepoint call returns must appear as an argument to the intrinsic.

In the following (simplified) example, `@foo` performs the call `@bar(42)` using the `gc.statepoint` intrinsic. This use of the intrinsic tells the code generator that the garbage collector needs the ability to locate the GC pointer `%ptr` in `@foo`'s stack frame, since the collector may be invoked during the execution of `@bar`.

```llvm
declare {%stack_ty, i32} @bar(%stack_ty %sp_arg, i32 %arg)

define i32 @foo(i32 %arg) {
  ;;; ...
  %ptr = ; an i64*, tracked by the GC
  %raw = ; an i32

  ;;; perform the call @bar(42)
  %tok = call token @llvm.gc.statepoint(
             i32 (i32) @bar, ; callee
             i32 42,         ; arg(s)
             i64* %ptr       ; gc pointer(s)
             )

  ;;; %ptr is now invalid. must use relocated version.
  %relo_ptr = call i64* @llvm.gc.relocate(token %tok, i32 1)

  ;;; obtain the value returned by @bar
  %retVal = call i32 @llvm.gc.result(token %tok)

  ;;; ... uses of %raw, %relo_ptr, etc ...
}
```

The implementation of Statepoints in the code generator is responsible for lowering the `gc.statepoint` call into an ordinary call where, just before the call, the GC pointers are always saved somewhere in the stack frame for the collector to find.
The location chosen within the stack frame is communicated to the garbage collector through an additional data section, [the stackmap](https://llvm.org/docs/StackMaps.html#stackmap-format), that is added to the assembly / object file.



Proposal
--------

I'm proposing a extension to the existing GC Statepoint functionality, which I have seperated into two parts for clarity:

(1) To support the stackless model, we need the ability to specify the _location_ of the stack frame in the heap.
We cannot use the existing stack that LLVM assumes is present, since in a stackless model we have a second "stack" (which is typically heap allocated) that we explicitly initialize and use.
Thus, we add the ability to use an IR value as a pointer to memory where the frame should be allocated.

(2) In addition, we need the ability to partially control the _layout_ of the frame so that this second "stack" can be used by the code generated by the front-end. Specifying where GC pointers should be placed is pretty simple.
The other required components of a stack frame, the call's return address and any register spills, are not real values in the IR.
Thus, we add an abstraction to tell the code generator where they should be placed.

### Examples

Let's consider our first example, where `@foo` calls `@bar`, written for a "stackless" model.
Both `@foo` and `@bar` now accept and return a secondary stack, `%sp`, as their first argument when called, and the first structure member on return.

In addition, we need to specify a layout for the frame to be compatible with our runtime system: from low to high addresses we have GC pointers, the return address, non-GC values, and then any register spills.
This can be achieved using the proposed `gc.frame.*` intrinsics below:

```llvm
%stack_ty = type i64*
declare %stack_ty @AllocHeap(i32)
declare {%stack_ty, i32} @bar(%stack_ty %sp_arg, i32 %arg)

define {%stack_ty, i32} @foo(%stack_ty %sp_arg, i32 %arg) {
  ;;; ...
  %ptr = ; an i64*, tracked by the GC
  %raw = ; an i32

  ;;; NEW: allocate space for the frame
  %spill_sz = call i32 @llvm.gc.frame.spillsz()
  %frame_sz = add i32 %spill_sz, 32
  %sp = call %stack_ty @AllocHeap(i32 %frame_sz)

  ;;; NEW: specify a layout for the frame
  %frameTok = call token @llvm.gc.frame.layout(
        %stack_ty %sp,  ; where to allocate the stack frame
        i32 16,         ; byte offset for return address
        i32 32          ; byte offset for start of spill area
    )

  ;;; NEW: record frame writes at specified byte offsets
  call void @llvm.gc.frame.save(token %frameTok, %stack_ty %sp_arg, i32 0)
  call void @llvm.gc.frame.save(token %frameTok, i64* %ptr, i32 8)
  call void @llvm.gc.frame.save(token %frameTok, i64* %raw, i32 24)

  ;;; perform the call @bar(42)
  %tok = call token @llvm.gc.frame.statepoint(
             i32 (i32) @bar,   ; callee
             i32 42,           ; arg(s)
             token %frameTok   ; frame layout
             )

  ;;; NEW: %sp and %frameTok are now invalid since the GC might have
  ;;; relocated the frame. we obtain the new version.
  %relo_frameTok = call token @llvm.gc.frame.accessor(token %tok)

  ;;; %ptr is now invalid. must use relocated version. NEW: now a byte offset
  %relo_ptr = call i64* @llvm.gc.frame.load(token %relo_frameTok, i32 8)

  ;;; obtain the value(s) returned by @bar
  %retVal = call i32 @llvm.gc.frame.result(token %tok)

  ;;; ... uses of %raw, %relo_ptr, etc ...
}
```

Note that the primary changes here are an expansion of certian aspects that were previously left undefined in `gc.statepoint` to allow more control by fron
t-ends:

(1) `gc.frame.layout` wraps the pointer to the frame (i.e., the location) along with some layout requirements for the non-representable values (the return address and spill area).

(2) The use of `gc.frame.save` corresponds to listing the live GC pointers in `gc.statepoint` calls so they are saved to the frame, however, now we can control the layout within the frame. Similarly, `gc.frame.load` corresponds to Statepoint's `gc.relocate` to freshly load the values that were saved to the frame.

Just as in `gc.statepoint`, any values that are used after the call to `@bar` that are *not* explicitly stored and reloaded from the frame will be automatically stored and reloaded from the frame's spill area.
This applies to both explicit LLVM IR values and any values generated during code generation.
The size of this spill area will be filled in by the code generator via the `gc.frame.spillsz` intrinsic.
As usual, it is assumed that the garbage collector will not modify the spill area or the return address.

### Function Call

Here is an example of making a function call, where we build a continuation
frame where the return address is somewhere in the middle of the frame:

```llvm

define {i64*, i64} @bar(i64*, i64) {
  ; ...
}

define void @foo(...) {

; live vals == lv0 ... lvN

; as defined by target: ptr is 8 bytes wide.
;
;                      addresses
;  low                                             high
;       -8          +8    +16    +24    .....     +72
;       | lv0 | lv1 | lv2 |  RA  |   spill area   |
;             SP
;

%buildTok = call token @llvm.frame.layout(i64* %sp,
                              i32 16,  ; RA offset
                              i32 24,  ; spill area offset
                              i32 48,  ; spill area size
                              i32 0,   ; call sp argnum
                              i32 0    ; rtrn sp argnum
                              )

; record stack frame saves
call void @llvm.frame.save(token %buildTok, i32* %lv0, i32 -8)
call void @llvm.frame.save(token %buildTok, i64* %lv1, i32 0)
call void @llvm.frame.save(token %buildTok, i64* %lv2, i32 8)
; ...
%returnTok = call token @llvm.frame.call(
                            token %buildTok,  ; frame for this call
                            {i64*, i64}(i64*, i64)* @bar, ; func
                            i64 7  ; arg(s)
                            )

%accessTok = call token @llvm.frame.accessor(token %returnTok)
%lv0_new = call i32* @llvm.frame.restore(token %accessTok, i32 -8)
; ...
%sp_new = call i64* @llvm.frame.sp(token %returnTok)
; ...
}
```

In fact, the SP is not defined to be at the top or bottom of any particular
chunk of memory, it's just a location in memory from which we define a function call frame
relative to that pointer.
The SP is always passed to the callee so that it may return back to the
caller.
To be specific, after a call, we know the following information about the
values within the frame before & after the call:

- Non-pointer values and addrspace(0) pointers are bitwise equal.
- All bits in the spill area were preserved.
- The return address's value is undefined.

Thus, addrspace(1) pointers may have been updated, i.e., by the garbage collector.

What the callee *does* with the SP is not defined, we only require
that the callee returns a pointer

Notes:
  - All offsets are relative to the location pointed to by SP.
  - We don't specify a "size" for the frame because
    that would only be needed if we were *moving* SP, but we are not.
    Once SP is captured, it does not move.
  - Any values *not* explicitly saved in the frame that are needed after
    the call will be automatically stored in the spill area. This applies to
    both explicit LLVM IR values and any values generated during codegen.
  - If the spill area is insufficient, an error is thrown.

### Function Return

At the moment, the cleanest way to handle it seems to be attaching
a partial-layout to the stack pointer.
One benefit of this approach is that it can generalize in the future to
returning values in the stack frame.

Of course, it is up to the front-end to ensure that all callers & callees
have matching layout specifications for the specific stack pointer.

```llvm
define {i64*, i64} @bar(i64*, i64) {
  ; ...
  %layoutTok = call token @llvm.frame.layout(i64* %sp, ; stack pointer
                               i32 16    ; return address offset
                               )
  %retTok = call {i64*, i64} @llvm.frame.return.TYPE(token %layoutTok, i64 12)
  ret {i64*, i64} %retTok
}
```

Note how the callee is also returning the stack pointer to its caller,
which was wrapped up in the layout token.

Existing Prototype
------------------

**TODO** link to a diff on github and explain the current state of the cpscall patch, and how this proposal is a more general version of that patch.


Related Ideas
-------------

#### Coroutines

The work on [coroutines](https://llvm.org/docs/Coroutines.html) in LLVM may appear to be similiar to this proposal, since they both deal with the concept of suspending and resuming a function, but LLVM's coroutines are different in a number of important ways.

The [coroutine lowering passes](https://llvm.org/docs/Coroutines.html#coroutine-transformation) involve splitting IR functions apart at each suspension point and inserting a return of the frame laid out by the pass.
This may work just fine for implementing coroutines, but not for general function
calls in a garbage-collected runtime system. **TODO** Problems include:

1. Lack of control over layout, and probably rules that enable moving GC.
2. Incompatible with general function calls, only ugly tricks that involve
a trampoline.
3. Inhibits optimization of the LLVM IR if we just generate pre-split code!


#### Calling Conventions

Calling conventions in LLVM can only specify the layout of function arguments
on the internal stack.
A sopisticated lowering of a calling convention can be used to implement many
parts of this proposal (not all), however, it would need to be done specifically
for one LLVM front-end.
